# IoT-based-Accident-Detection
The first code detects vehicle accidents. In the event of an accident, it fetches the car coordinates using a GPS module and sends an alert sms, containing those coordinates as well as corresponding Google maps location link , to the emergency contacts via IFTTT SMS Service. 
The second code is an additional feature that can be installed inside a car. It displays several weather parameters like temperature, pressure, air quality etc. on a LCD Screen using openweathermap API. Can also be programmed to display weather forecasts using paid APIs.

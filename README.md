# IoT-based-Accident-Detection
The "sms" code detects vehicle accidents. 
In the event of an accident, this model detects it and fetches the car coordinates from a GPS module and then sends an alert sms, containing the coordinates as well as corresponding Google maps location link , to the emergency contacts via IFTTT SMS Service. 
The second code ("weathertest") is an additional feature that can be installed inside a car. It displays several weather parameters like temperature, pressure, air quality etc. on a LCD Screen using openweathermap API. It can also be programmed to display weather forecasts using the paid API version.
